# Fully_Convolutional_Semantic_Segementation_ImagedataGenerator
CamVid is an open source autonomous driving dataset with labels to perform semantic segmentation
The code performs the function of generating data and corresponding semantic labels in batches of customizable size to train large data
It is similiar in function to ImageDataGenerator in Keras, but is extended to work on semantic segmentation datasets.
